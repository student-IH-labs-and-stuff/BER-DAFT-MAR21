## Here are some final project briefs for anyone who doesnt have a firm project in mind - feel free to adopt one of these or adapt it to your own preferences 

each project brief contains a suggested direction, data sources, and would be achievable in the time allowed for the FBP 

--------------------
+ Our class slack workspace- json wrangling,  to discover insights, links posted from the start of the course - it is possible to download the full json code from the beginning of the course - could you build a reusable python tool which would allow any ironhack class to pull the useful (and gdpr compliant) information from their slack workspace data - and pitch it to the ironhack bosses ? for example shared web resources, the most active channels, topics, threads and emojis
+ Data source : in [this folder](https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BER-DAFT-MAR21/blob/main/Project/final_project/Data-FT-Ber-03-2021%20Slack%20export%20Mar%2018%202021%20-%20Apr%2027%202021.zip)

-------------------

+ air pollution levels in cities- comparative analysis paris/ london  - trends and identifying specific places or times of year/day to avoid - can city dwellers make simple lifestyle changes to lower their levels of exposure to harmful air pollutants?

 ------------------     

+ hospital admissions and health interventions by care professionals /doctors / government  - do specific care client interventions for the elderly contribute (in x country) to lower levels of emergency admissions in the same group / overall ? (focus on non covid-19 times) Do government anti smoking campaigns /safe sex campaigns / exercise campaigns have a substantial (statistically significant) effect on the levels of x after 6, 12, 18 months?  I have found some good data sources for UK but I am sure equivalent data can be found for other countries

-----------------

+ beer project - a bit of fun- why not? inspired by a slack conversation mid week on nigerian consumption of guinness - something like 'are certain beers consumed more outside of their native country than at home and what are the conditions that make that happen?' example visualisation for inspiration: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/beer-europe?tab=featured 
+ Data sources https://www.statista.com/topics/4674/guinness-beer/ https://www.worldstopexports.com/beer-exports-by-country/ https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/beer-consumption-by-country https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/beer-consumption-per-person

---------------

+ cycling and covid - theres a lot of data available on cycling and the news has been full of the uptake in cycling during covid. Could you scrape data from different sources and see if statistically the data does back these claims up? eg https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/the-great-bicycle-boom-of-2020.html
+ Data sources https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w1 https://www.bicycle-guider.com/bike-facts-stats/ 
+ what about combining this with the facebook movement data and looking to identify time series and geographical links with bike sales in particular regions ?
+ some countries were already very bike heavy - vietnam, china, the netherlands - can we use those countries to compare to the other countries who have only lately joined the cycling boom?


----------

+ how many people have access to culture ? is there an imbalance in where cultural venues are located and the communities / wealth of surrounding neighbourhoods? are cultural venues easily accessible to people newly arrived to big cities and who do not yet speak the local language? 
+ project will involve scraping, map work, visual analysis, statistical inference, joining data sets together- my data examples are from london but could be extended
