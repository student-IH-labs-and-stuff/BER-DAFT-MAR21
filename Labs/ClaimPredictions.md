# Lab | Predicting Claim Amount with ML Linear Regression

## Introduction

For this lab, we still keep using the marketing_customer_analysis.csv file that you can find in the files_for_lab folder.

It's time to put it all together. Remember the previous rounds and follow the steps as shown in previous lectures.

## 01 - Problem (case study)
Data Description.
Goal.

## 02 - Getting Data
Read the .csv file.

## 03 - Cleaning/Wrangling/EDA
Change headers names.
Deal with NaN values.
Categorical Features.
Numerical Features.
Exploration.

## 04 - Processing Data
Dealing with outliers.
Normalization.
Encoding Categorical Data.
Splitting into train set and test set.

## 05 - Modeling
Apply linear regression model.

## 06 - Model Validation
You should gather appropriate metrics to evaluate model accuracy - such as : 
R2.
MSE.
RMSE.
MAE.

## 07 - Reporting
Present results.
