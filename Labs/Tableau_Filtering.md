# Lab | Tableau -Dynamic Filtering

Build the following charts making use of the filter types and edit filter options in tableau and publish them to your tableau public account (or upload the workbook to your github) in order to submit the url via the Student Portal

## Your Challenge

Using the data set [laureate.csv](laureate.csv) and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, create the following charts to visualise and allow end users to interact with the viz using filters:

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels/legend or map layers.)

1. Display the number of nobel awards for all categories excluding the nulls (as a hidden filter) awarded between 1996 and 2016, ideally using a visible date range filter. Edit the filter to give it the title ' filter year of award ' suggestion - use a sorted bar chart to summarise the awards by category
2. Duplicate your view, and replace the filters with two new visible dynamic filters: a **select categories** multiple choice drop down list filter and a **select a gender** single value list filter- filter to female award winners in medicine, peace and literature. Edit the title of this view to display the filters chosen. 
3. Create a map showing city and country of birth for every award won. Filter the view with a dynamic drop down list for the **Died Country** of each award winner with only relevant values showing in this filter- select Russia in the filter to show where were the winners who died in Russia actually born? To make this map tidy filter away unknown countries and cities from the view. 
4. BONUS: use a wildcard filter with a text table of award winner First Name, Last name, Motivation for award, to find all prize winners whose first name starts with B, and were born after 1950... do you recognise anyone? Neither filters need to be visible - but choose an appropriate descriptive title. 
**exra bonus** - concatenate the first and last names of the winners in a calculated field and replace the existing columns in your view with your new full name field.
