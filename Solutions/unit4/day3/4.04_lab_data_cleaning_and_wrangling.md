**REMEMBER**

- Education, employment status, policy, and vehicle class are somewhat unbalanced.
- For education, we could turn it into a binary variable (`college +-`), but I wouldn't touch it.
- The policy is redundant, maybe we can classify it in `L1`, `L2` and `L3` groups.
- Id concatenates luxury SUV, sports car and luxury car into luxury or among the other classes.
- For employment, we could divide them among employed, unemployed and inactive.
- We can see that having open complaints isn't that common, so we can turn it into a binary variable, open - not open.
- For the number of policies, we could join use 1, 2, 3, 4+.
